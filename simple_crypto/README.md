## Description

A C-based implementation of a simple cryptographic library called simple_crypto.

The library contains the three basic cryptographic algorithms
1. One-time pad
2. Caesar's cipher
3. Vigenère’s cipher


### One-time pad

The One-Time-Pad (OTP) algorithm is a very simple but yet very strong algorithm in the sense that it can not be cracked even with post-quantum techniques.The algorithm pairs each plaintext with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad). Specifically, each bit or byte/character of the plaintext is combined with the corresponding bit or byte/character from the random secret key. One-time pad requires that the secret key is of the same size or longer than the plaintext

#### Implementation


```
                                one_time_pad_generateRandomSecretKey 
			
This function is responsible to generate the random secret key which will be used during one_time_pad's encryption/decryption process.
The length of random secret key which is created,it is equal to length of user's input.

Parameters:
@param userInput : The plaintext which will be encrypted
@return Random secret key

```

```
                                one_time_pad_encrypting 
	
This function is responsible for one_time_pad's encryption.
In case that are created non-printable characters during XOR-ing, they replace with hashtag(#).
Internally on this function is printed the encrypted text on printable format(with hashtags) , but is returned the "correct" form of encrypted text that's the encrypted text without the hashtags.

Parameters:
@param userInput : The plaintext which will be encrypted
@param randomSecretKey : Random secret key which was generated by one_time_pad_generateRandomSecretKey function
@return  Encrypted text

```

```
				                one_time_pad_decrypting 
	
This function is responsible for one_time_pad's decryption.
The parameter userInputLength is used because it can be generated during the XOR-ing the character backslash before the end of encryptedText.

Parameters:
@param encryptedText : Encrypted text which was generated using one_time_pad_encrypting function
@param randomSecretKey : Random secret key which was generated by one_time_pad_generateRandomSecretKey function
@param userInputLength : The length of user's input
@return  Decrypted text a.k.a user input

```


### Caesar's cipher

This technique is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each byte/character of the plaintext is replaced by a byte/character found at some fixed number of positions down the alphabet/ASCII set. 

#### Implementation


```
					            alphaNumeric

alphaNumeric is constant char array which contains the set of number(0-9),uppercase(A-Z) and lowercase(a-z) letters
alphaNumeric used during the process of Caesar's encryption and decryption.
It was used to avoid the "jumps" between the ASCII code of numbers,uppercase and lowercase letters

```

```
				                caesar_encrypting 
	
This function is responsible for Caesar's encryption

Parameters:
@param userInput : The plaintext which will be encrypted
@param key : Fixed number of positions down the ASCII set(a.k.a shifted positions)
@return  Encrypted text

```

```
				                caesar_decrypting 
	
This function is responsible for Caesar's decryption

Parameters:
@param encryptedText : Encrypted text which was generated using caesar_encrypting function
@param key  : Fixed number of positions down the ASCII set(a.k.a shifted positions)
@return  Decrypted text a.k.a user input

```


### Vigenère’s cipher


#### Implementation
The Vigenère’s cipher encrypts an alphabetic plaintext using a series of interwoven Caesar’s ciphers. In order to encrypt a message, the algorithm uses a table of alphabets, namely tabula recta, which has the alphabet written out 26 times in different rows, each alphabet shifted cyclically to the left compared to the previous alphabet, corresponding to the 26 possible Caesar ciphers.



```
			                    vigenere_generate_key_phrase

This function is responsible to generate the key phrase which will be used during Vigenere's encryption/decryption process
The length of key phrase must be the same with the user's input length

Parameters:
@param userInputLength : The length of plaintext which will be encrypted
@param key : The key which will be used to generate the key phrase
@return Key phrase

```

```
				                vigenere_encrypting
	
This function is responsible for Vigenere's encryption

Parameters:
@param userInput : The plaintext which will be encrypted
@param keyphrase : Key phrase which was generated by vigenere_generate_key_phrase function
@return Encrypted text

```

```
				                vigenere_decrypting	

This function is responsible for Vigenere's decryption

Parameters:
@param encryptedText : Encrypted text which was generated using vigenere_encrypting function
@param keyphrase  : Key phrase which was generated by vigenere_generate_key_phrase function
@return  Decrypted text a.k.a user input

```
